SignalR Information: SignalR is a real-time communication library by Microsoft.
SignalR enables: Live price feeds, instant order status updates, account balance and PnL updates, notifications for fills, stops, or brackets triggered.
It allows the server to push updates to the client instantly, instead of the client repeatedly polling the server for information.

5. Frequently Asked Questions & Capabilities
Programming Knowledge Required: Yes, development experience is needed.
Supported Programming Languages: Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, .NET, and more. Languages need to be able to call a REST API or use WebSocket connections.
Software for Bot Creation: Visual Studio, WebStorm, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, among others.
Bracket, Trailing Stop, OCO Orders: Yes, these can be built using the API. Refer to the documentation at https://gateway.docs.projectx.com/docs/intro/.
Partially Exiting Positions: Yes, by monitoring positions, you can close or adjust as needed.
Managing Multiple Accounts/Strategies: Yes, one subscription allows managing trades across all your TopstepX accounts.
Using API Alongside TopstepX Platform: A single connection is allowed per username. Running both concurrently will cause a conflict and log you out. Tip: Start the API connection first, then open TopstepX charts.
Rate Limits: Yes, 400 requests can be handled concurrently.
Custom Indicators, Alerts, Trading Bots: The API is currently for making trades; you cannot create indicators at this time.
Custom Risk Controls / Flatten/Reverse: Yes, this requires skill and monitoring open positions.
Porting Strategies from TradingView, NinjaTrader, Thinkorswim: Yes, but not directly. Strategies need to be converted to utilize the API's setup.
Webhook Integration from TradingView to ProjectX: Supported. Examples are in the API documentation.
Running on VPS/Cloud (e.g., Google Cloud Run): Not at this time; running automated systems in a VPS is currently prohibited.
Running Locally on Laptop: Yes, you can take your code with you.
Copy-Trading: You can set up the API to process orders across any of your accounts; however, they need to be managed individually. Copy-trading features may be available soon.
Third-Party Tools vs. Custom-Built: No third-party tools (like Strategy Builder in NinjaTrader) are available; all automation must be custom-built.
Paper Trading: Yes, you need a Practice Account set up in the new Dashboard.
TILT Data Access: Not accessible at this time, but options are being reviewed.
Code Privacy: Code created with the API is private unless you share it.
Marketplace: No real "Marketplace" at this time. You can post in Topstep's Discord.
Retrieving Candle Data (non-time-based): You receive real-time data, but you would need to code Renko and Heikin Ashi mathematical formulas for reference. Plotting candles is currently not possible.
Full List of Tradable Contracts: Yes, available via a Topstep API Help Center Article.
